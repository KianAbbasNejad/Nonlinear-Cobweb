# Nonlinear-Cobweb
This code calculates the following for a simple non-linear cobweb model: 
1. Iteration Loop
2. Time Series 
3. Bifurcation Diagram
4. Parameter Basins of Attraction (incomplete)

The code is inspired by Hommes (2013) and his lectures at university of
Amsterdam as well as the UvA CeNDEF software '*E&FChaos*'.

I haven't added GUI to the code but I've done my best to make it easy to change parameters or the difference equation and play around. :)
